Hello! I'm Tati, a Front-end Developer specialised in Visual and Web Accessibility.  I'm passionate about creating inclusive and accessible websites for all users.

When I'm not in front of the computer, I love going to the gym, reading a fantasy book, or listening to true crime podcasts while coloring adult coloring books. In addition, I'm also a big fan of beers, Irish pubs and weekend trips.

Throughout my career, I have worked on various projects, including design systems, e-commerce and internet banking websites. My experience, combined with my passion for accessibility, has enabled me to deliver high-quality work that meets the needs of all users.

One of the ways I stay updated with the latest front-end trends and best practices is by participating and speaking at IT conferences and writing articles on my blog. In addition, I have coordinated several conferences, including those focused on web development, and worked to encourage women in tech. You can find all my contributions, past talks and volunteer work in my [public speaking](https://tatianeaguirres.github.io/public-speaking/).

In summary, my goal as a front-end developer is to create websites that are both beautiful and user-focused, while also sharing knowledge and encouraging women in tech.
