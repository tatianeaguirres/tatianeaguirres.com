This is the GitHub repository for my personal website and blog, built using the [Tailwind Next.js Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog/) template. The website is powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The website showcases my blog posts on various topics, including front-end and personal development. It also features my past projects and initiatives, giving visitors a glimpse into my work and experiences.

The tech stack used in this project includes Next.js for building fast and scalable React applications, and Tailwind CSS for designing modern and responsive user interfaces. The template provides a clean and minimalistic design, making it easy for me to customize and add my own content.

Feel free to check out the live website at tatianeaguirres.com to explore my blog posts and past projects!
